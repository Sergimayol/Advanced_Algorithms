# Playground for the study of the performance of the different algorithms

This folder contains the code used to study the performance of the different algorithms. It should be open as an independent project in your IDE.

## Contents

-   [Notebooks](notebooks): Jupyter notebooks used to study the performance of the different algorithms.
-   [src](src): Source code for generating the data and running the algorithms.

> **Note**: For running the notebooks, you need to install the dependencies in the [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) file. You can do this by running `pip install -r requirements.txt` in the root folder of the project. It is recommended to use a virtual environment for this. Also, it's important to run the java code in the [src](./src) folder before running the notebooks.
